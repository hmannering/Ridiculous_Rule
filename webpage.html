 <h1>Most Ridiculous Rule</h1>
<p>My most ridiciulous rule is not bring able to bring my phone up to bed. My parents never want me to bring up my phone because they think I will be on it all night. This is so ridiculous because both of my parents and sister bring up their phone. </p>
<h2> Why does this rule exist? </h2>
<p> I do not get why I am not allowed because my mom is on her phone always before she goes to bed. I just want to bring up my phone so I can set my alarm and look at it. Sometimes I bring it up just to set alarm and I get in trouble for it.</p>
